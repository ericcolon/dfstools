[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/znmeb/tidysportsfeeds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/znmeb/tidysportsfeeds)

## Getting started
1. Read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/znmeb/tidysportsfeeds/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) and [contributor's guide](https://github.com/znmeb/tidysportsfeeds/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Sign up for an account at [MySportsFeeds.com](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and [Stattleship.com](https://api.stattleship.com/). You will need accounts on both to use this package; the two APIs have different capabilities and the R package uses both APIs.
3. Sign up for monthly support of the API providers on Patreon. After you do that, they will activate your logins / API tokens.

## Installing the package    
1. Install git, R and RStudio for your work environment. This is a developers' release; for the moment, you'll need to be familiar with git / GitHub, R and RStudio. 

    I test regularly on Windows and Arch Linux, but any environment that supports RStudio should work. If anything doesn't work or the documentation is unclear, please file an issue at <https://github.com/znmeb/tidysportsfeeds/issues/new>
2. Open RStudio and install the packages `devtools` and `roxygen2` from CRAN.
3. In the RStudio console, type `devtools::install_github("znmeb/tidysportsfeeds")`.

## Some philosophy / roadmap
I'm planning to grow this package some, but not as a full-fledged DFS analytics suite. Most of it will be on an as-needed basis; I'll want to run an analysis and I'll code up the API interfaces I need for the task.

The four tasks I have coded (subject to some refactoring to be done) are

1. Predicting game scores and win probabilities via `mvglmmRank`,
2. Visualization of players' and teams' fantasy point distributions with `ggplot2`,
3. Archetypoidal analysis (`Anthropometry`), and
4. Predicting fantasy points via a general linear model (`MASS::glm`).
