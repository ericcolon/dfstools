2.  Sign up for an account at
    [MySportsFeeds.com](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and
    [Stattleship.com](https://api.stattleship.com/). You will need
    accounts on both to use this package; the two APIs have different
    capabilities and the R package uses both APIs.

    you do that, they will activate your logins / API tokens.

    required to use the package\!***

## Installing the package

1.  Install git, R and RStudio for your work environment. This is a
    developers’ release; for the moment, you’ll need to be familiar with
    git / GitHub, R and RStudio.
    
    I test regularly on Windows and Arch Linux, but any environment that
    supports RStudio should work. If anything doesn’t work or the
    documentation is unclear, please file an issue at
    <https://github.com/znmeb/dfstools/issues/new>

2.  Open RStudio and install the packages `devtools` and `roxygen2` from
    CRAN.

3.  In the RStudio console, type
    `devtools::install_github("znmeb/dfstools")`.
