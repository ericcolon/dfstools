## Installing the package

1.  Install git, R and RStudio for your work environment. This is a
    developers’ release; for the moment, you’ll need to be familiar with
    git / GitHub, R and RStudio.
    
    I test regularly on Windows, Arch Linux and the [Data Science Pet
    Containers](https://github.com/znmeb/data-science-pet-containers)
    toolset, but any environment that supports RStudio should work. If
    anything doesn’t work or the documentation is unclear, please file
    an issue at <https://github.com/znmeb/dfstools/issues/new>

2.  Open RStudio and install the packages `devtools` and `roxygen2` from
    CRAN.

3.  In the RStudio console, type
    `devtools::install_github("znmeb/dfstools")`.
